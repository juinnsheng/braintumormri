# Deep Learning

This is my first time attempting a deep learning project to classify brain tumour based on MRI images
Thanks to Dhaval Patel, from @codebasics on Youtube for the tutorial.

Also thanks to Navoneel Chakrabarty, Swati Kanchan for the mri dataset on Kaggle
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri)
I have modified some codes accordingly using a different dataset as a practise.
Accuracy is about 70%.
