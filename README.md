# Deep Learning

This is my first time attempting a deep learning project to classify brain tumour based on MRI images
Thanks to Dhaval Patel, from @codebasics on Youtube for the tutorial.

Also thanks to Navoneel Chakrabarty, Swati Kanchan for the mri dataset on Kaggle

I have modified some codes accordingly using a different dataset as a practise.
Accuracy is about 70%.

Will continue to keep learning :)
